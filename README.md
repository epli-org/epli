# EPLI - Explain Paper Like I'm (5) / Sciren

Makes papers easy to understand, by reducing the number of google searches you need to perform as you read them.

## Frontend
Beautifies scientific papers, starting with arxiv-vanity urls.
- Displays the abstracts + summaries of references

Future work:
- Displays a pop-up on top of jargon, containing the definition for that piece of jargon
  - If definition is within another paper, could potentially do a jump-to-definition of some sort

## Backend
Key endpoints:
- Return an abstract, introduction, etc. + a summary for each of these sections and the entire paper
- Return profile / bio info for a given author + email
- Recommend next papers for a given paper
